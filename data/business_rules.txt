A "Trading node" has a "local\_value", "total\_power", "outgoing", "ingoing" and **whether it's inland**. A "Country" has a "name", "development" and a "home\_node" (home node). Between "Trading nodes“, there can be a directional edge [source]. It connects from a higher node to a lower node.  A "Country" can have a non-directional connection to a trading node. Each connection has a unique "base\_trading\_power" for each node. 
If a specific node is the home node of a country, that country earns profit from that node. The profit is proportional to the "local\_value" plus "ingoing" and the ratio of the country’s trading power and the total trading power of that node. i.e. (local\_value+ingoing)*(country\_trading\_power / total\_trading\_power)

If a specific node is source of a country's home node, the country moves a value to dest node, proportional to the ratio of the country's trading power to the node's total trading power and (local\_value + ingoing). In the dest node, the moved value is increased by 1.05 times and added to the ingoing. A "Merchant" belongs to a country and can be assigned to a specific trading node. A "Merchant" belonging to a trading node adds 2 to the trading power of the country's trading node and amplifies it by 1.05 times. *If one of the edges has an inland node, the added value changes to 2+max(development/3, 50). (optional)* If a specific trading node has more than one dest node, and a country that doesn't have that node as its home node places a "Merchant" on the Trading node, it can decide which dest node to move the "current\_value" to. That is, the country can move a "current\_value" proportional to its trading power to a specific dest node. If no merchant is placed, when there's more than one dest node, they lose the right to decide the direction. In other words, the country's "current\_value" proportional to its trading power flows out in proportion to other outflows to the dest nodes. If there's only one dest node, it doesn't matter.
